[3:38:52] <Eldar_Warlock> LCS, aka "Literally Cannot Sidelane", is Riot's premier Wildcard region held in the saltiest continent and denoted as such, NA. It is ridiculed for its poor international performance and macro, favouring the "NARAM" style.

[3:38:54] <TAO_DanDy> in my 7+Twitch chat career i always had to ctrl+c and be repetitive. As of now at least, current copy pasta doesnt fit this principle. Twitch chat is unable/unwilling to make changes to fit that goal, so we mutually agreed that i stepdown.
